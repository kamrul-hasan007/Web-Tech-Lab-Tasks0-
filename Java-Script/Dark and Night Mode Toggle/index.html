            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a web developer with a strong passion for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in Front-End development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am exploring full-stack development with Node.js and React. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive web experiences and continuously learning new technologies to improve my craft.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like contributing to open-source projects, experimenting with UI/UX designs, and writing tutorials for beginners to help them get started with web development. My goal is to build digital solutions that are not only functional but also aesthetically appealing.</p>
