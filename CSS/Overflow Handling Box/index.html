        One of the biggest strengths of AI assistants is their ability to understand natural language. Unlike older systems that required specific commands, modern assistants can interpret how humans naturally speak. Whether someone says, “Set a reminder for tomorrow morning,” or “Wake me up early,” the AI understands and takes action. This makes the experience more intuitive and accessible, especially for users who are not familiar with technology.
